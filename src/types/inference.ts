/**
 * Inference Provider API (IPA) types, from `ipa-tools`.
 *
 * They were vendored while the package was 0.1; it now ships the same types plus
 * the fallback machinery grimoire uses, so this is a thin alias layer: the names
 * the app already uses (`InferenceMessage`, `InferenceTool`) mapped onto the
 * package's (`Message`, `Tool`), and `Inference` extended with the one thing
 * outside the spec.
 *
 * Note that `ipa-tools` augments `Window` with `inference?: Inference` — its
 * own, without the experimental namespace. Declaring it again here would
 * conflict, so `services/inference.ts` casts once at the lookup instead.
