/**
 * Resolving a community the way a person names one.
 *
 * `resolveStoredCommunity` exists so `chat` can share its single argument with
 * every NIP-19 identifier there is: it must answer "this is a community I hold"
 * or nothing at all, never "probably". `parseConcordCommand` is the lenient one
 * — `concord` has no other meaning for its argument, so an unresolved query is
 * carried through as a prefix rather than refused.
