/**
 * The mempool.space mark, for a link to a Bitcoin transaction.
 *
 * Vendored under `public/` rather than hotlinked, for the same reason Hex's
 * face is: a mark that only renders when someone else's CDN is reachable is
 * not much of a mark. It also matters more here than for an avatar — loading
 * it from mempool.space would tell them, on render and without the reader
 * doing anything, that this person is looking at a page about a transaction.
 * Following the link says that deliberately; the icon should not say it first.
