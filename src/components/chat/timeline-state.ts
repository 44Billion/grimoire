/**
 * What the timeline pane should be showing: the list, a wait, or nothing.

 * `usePaintedContainer` holds the virtualized list back until the container
 * can be measured in a painting document — a mosaic tile mid-split, a
 * workspace that is not on screen, a tab the browser stopped rendering — and
 * the fallback behind that gate said "No messages yet. Start the
 * conversation!" A conversation the reader has been having for months reads as
 * empty, with a live composer under it, and the reader has no way to tell that
 * from the truth.
 *
 * A gate that is still shut is a WAIT. Only a timeline that has arrived, with
 * nothing in it, is empty.
