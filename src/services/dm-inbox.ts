/**
 * Getting this account's gift wraps off the relays and into the store.
 *
 * Reads run on the SINGLETON pool, and they ANSWER NIP-42 — see
 * `dm-read-auth.ts`. That is the opposite of the publish path
 * (`dm-publish-pool.ts`) and deliberately so: this REQ asks the user's own
 * inbox relays for the user's own mail, most of which require authentication
 * before they will serve it, and identifying yourself to your own mailbox
 * discloses nothing it does not already hold. A read that does not answer the
 * challenge is indistinguishable from an empty inbox.
 *
 * Three things shape everything here:
 *
 * - **A wrap's `created_at` is randomised up to two days into the past** so its
 *   arrival time says nothing about when it was written. A cursor-based `since`
 *   therefore filters out almost every wrap that is genuinely new, which is why
 *   {@link WRAP_BACKDATE_SECS} exists and why the cursor is slack rather than
 *   exact.
 * - **Opening a wrap costs two `nip44.decrypt` calls.** Against a browser
 *   extension or a bunker that is two prompts or two round trips, per message,
 *   so a cold inbox of two hundred is four hundred of them. Hence the consent
 *   gate, the seen-wrap memo, and unlocking in small waves.
 * - **Nothing is decrypted twice, ever.** The rumor goes to Dexie and the wrap
 *   id to the seen table, including when it would not open — a wrap that failed
 *   once fails identically forever, and retrying it is a prompt per session for
 *   a message that does not exist.
