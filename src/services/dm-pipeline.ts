/**
 * One inbox pipeline per account, however many windows are watching it.
 *
 * Every mounted `useDirectMessages` used to run the whole sequence itself:
 * resolve the relays, open a standing REQ, sync two pages, walk the history,
 * import the legacy plane. Three panes are open in an ordinary session — a
 * chat browser, a second window, a NIP-17 conversation — so all of it ran three
 * times over, three standing REQs deep, and the two-minute top-up ran three
 * times every two minutes. The decryptions deduplicate through the seen-wrap
 * memo, so the waste was invisible; the REQs and the relay traffic were not.
 *
 * So the pipeline belongs to the ACCOUNT and the components hold references to
 * it. The last one to leave takes it down, which is also what makes a handoff
 * work: a window closing while another is still open does not interrupt a walk
 * halfway through, the way a leader-election between components would.
 *
 * EVERY relay read of the gift-wrap stream comes through here, including the
 * ones a conversation asks for itself — the NIP-17 adapter opening a room and
 * paging it backwards. The inbox is one undifferentiated stream, so two callers
 * asking at once are asking the same question, and the answer reaches all of
 * them the same way regardless of which one paid for it.
 *
 * Nothing here paints. Stored messages reach the UI through `dm-bus`, exactly
 * as they did when a wrap arrived on the live subscription — the only thing
 * this reports is the walk's own progress, which nothing else can observe.
