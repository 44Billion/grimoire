/**
 * The local mirror of this account's NIP-17 messages.
 *
 * A gift wrap is opened exactly once, here, and what persists is the rumor its
 * author signed. Everything downstream — the conversation list, a thread, the
 * unread count — is an indexed Dexie query with no crypto in it, so a reload
 * costs no signer prompts and works with no relay reachable. This is the same
 * contract `concord-rumor-store.ts` holds, for the same reasons.
 *
 * **This module is the only door.** Every acceptance rule lives here so there
 * is one place to read them and one place they can be wrong:
 *
 * - kinds 14 (message), 15 (file), 7 (reaction), 5 (delete) and 4 (legacy)
 *   only;
 * - the rumor id is recomputed and a lying one refused;
 * - a rumor whose author is not a participant is refused, which is NIP-59's
 *   own anti-spoof rule pushed to the last possible moment;
 * - a rumor already past its NIP-40 deadline is refused, and one with a future
 *   deadline is stored with it and hidden when it passes.
 *
 * Rows are plaintext at rest, like the Concord rumors beside them, and a
 * logout wipes them.

 * cap, and the stuck badge would return for exactly the >99-unread case.
 *
 * **Both bounds are clamped by the same allowance.** `created_at` is
 * author-chosen, so a year-3000 message would pin the badge forever. Bounded
 * here and at the stamp with {@link DM_MAX_FUTURE_SECS}.
 *
 * The lower bound is EXCLUSIVE: a message dated exactly `after` is the one the
 * reader last read.
 *
 * What does not count, and why each: the viewer's own messages, because
 * sending is reading; reactions and deletes, because a reaction to something
 * already read is not a message waiting; and anything past its NIP-40
 * deadline, because it is already gone from the timeline. Expiry is cheap to
 * judge from a row alone — deletion is not, which is what `latest` is for.
 *
 * There is no `mention` flag, unlike Concord's. NIP-17 p-tags every recipient
 * on every message, so the predicate is vacuously true: a conversation where
 * everything is a mention has no mentions.
